                <p class="content bodytxt">It is high tide, on a grey afternoon. Frothy waves gently caress the shore. At
                    Kovalam
                    beach, clad in bodysuits, two amateur surfers are trying to catch a wave. Nudging them along is a
                    young
                    boy in a yellow uniform: their coach.
                    The men paddle into the water on surfboards, turn to face the beach and wait. As soon as a wave hits
                    them, they attempt to ‘pop’ (stand on the board) and strike a superhero pose. A few seconds in, they
                    topple over with a splash. On the shore, their family enthusiastically tries to catch the few
                    seconds of
                    action on camera.</p>

                <p class="content bodytxt">
                    Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently became the world’s richest man once more, putting Amazon
                    founder
                    Jeff Bezos in second place. With a net worth of $200.7 billion, according to Forbes, Musk today is
                    one
                    of the most recognised and influential people in the tech space, a long, long way from where the
                    Stanford dropout was back in the 90s, when his life had its fair share of struggles.
                    Unknown to many, Musk’s first project was actually Zip2, a software company that developed an
                    internet-based platform that benefited the newspaper publishing industry by designing online city
                    guides. Founded in 1995, the company was purchased by Compaq Computer in 1999.
                    During the four years with the company, Musk would share a computer and code everyday at night,
                    seven
                    days a week to keep the website up. In a 2014 commencement speech at the University of Southern
                    California, Musk mentioned that he would sleep on a couch in a small rented office as he couldn’t
                    afford
                    an apartment. He’d also shower at the YMCA. Check out the clip where he talks about his experiences
                    below.

                    The current iteration of the OnePlus (number) series is the OnePlus 9. It features a 120Hz AMOLED
                    screen, the Snapdragon 888, up to 12GB RAM and 256GB UFS 3.1 storage. There is a 48MP+50MP+2MP
                    triple
                    camera and a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast charging.
                    These are the most affordable OnePlus devices so far and offer slightly watered-down specifications
                    compared to the Nord series. The lower mid-range phones aren’t the most powerful, but are great if
                    you
                    want a OnePlus phone but are tight on a budget.
                    In India, the OnePlus Nord CE is available with a 6.43 inch 90Hz AMOLED panel, a Snapdragon 750G
                    chip, a
                    64MP+8MP+2MP camera setup, 4,500mAh battery and 30W fast charging.

                    Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin relaunched the Varumun Kaapom scheme at an event near Vazhapadi
                    in
                    Salem on Wednesday. He reached Salem on Wednesday as part of a two-day visit to inaugurate various
                    government welfare schemes.
                    The Varumun Kaapom scheme provides preventive medical care and was initially launched by late Tamil
                    Nadu
                    chief minister and DMK patriarch Kalaignar Karunanidhi in December 2006.
                    During the recently held Budget session, the state health department had announced that it was
                    planning
                    to revive the scheme. In addition to Varumun Kaapom, the state government is also implementing the
                    Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam scheme. Government sources claimed that the second scheme has been
                    benefitting
                    40,000-50,000 people daily on an average. In addition to Varumun Kaapom, the state government is
                    also
                    implementing the Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam scheme.
